# Veriph.One Examples: PHP + Yii

Snippets and examples on how to use the Veriph.One SDK for your PHP/Yii projects. This repository contains projects created using Yii's auto-generated templates. As such, they might contain more boilerplate code than necessary.

Each folder contains independent and standalone projects that cover specific use cases. Feel free to download only the folder you need or the whole repository if applicable.

## Available Samples

1. Advanced: A simple implementation that includes two flows:
    - One to capture a phone number safely for the first time, usually helpful for sign up, KYC, and onboarding processes;
    - And another for Multi-Factor Auth, a process where you want a specific phone number (determined by your server) to be verified in order to continue with a transaction. It can be used for post-login multi-factor authentication or when executing sensitive operations in your web app.
2. Basic: If you are looking for an example using the basic template, let us know so we can add it in the future.
