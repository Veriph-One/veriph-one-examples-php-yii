# Veriph.One Example: PHP + Yii2 (Advanced)

A sample integration of the Veriph.One SDK to show how our service works. This project is a barebones implementation of Veriph.One's SDK based on the boilerplate code generated by the [Yii 2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) Advanced Template. **Please note that the project hasn't been optimized and many unnecessary files were kept and the implementation was limited to the `frontend` server**, everything else can be disregarded. Our technology is framework-agnostic so PHP, Yii, and the Advance template are not necessary for the integration to work.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have gone through the developer documentation to understand how to integrate phone-based verification to your web app. Developer docs can be found [here](https://developer.veriph.one/docs/intro).

### (Optional) Test the integration using this example

2. Clone this folder from the repo to test the integration in isolation.
3. Set your API Key and Secret in the `frontend/controllers/ApiController.php` file.
4. Use the [Veriph.One dashboard](https://dashboard.veriph.one) to configure your API Key's callback URL to `http://localhost:8080/verification-result`.
5. Run the server locally by using:

First execute:
```bash
$ php ./init
```

Then, to serve the content, use:
```bash
$ php yii serve --docroot="frontend/web"
```

6. Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser to see the example in action.
7. Tinker with the code and the API Key configuration to better understand how to integrate the SDK into your codebase.

### Suggestions on how to proceed

8. Integrate the verification endpoints into your server and connect your business logic.
9. Store the session UUID and the verification results in your database.
10. Create API Keys for each environment you use to perform adequate testing.
11. Upgrade your Veriph.One account to a paid plan to access more configuration and setup options during phone verifications.
12. If applicable, integrate the mobile SDK into your mobile apps and other platforms.
